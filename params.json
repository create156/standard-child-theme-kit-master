In the \"Appearance\" menu, click on \"Themes\".\r\n4. On the \"Themes\" page, click on the \"Install Themes\" tab.\r\n5. Click on the \"Upload\" link at the top of the page.\r\n6. On the \"Upload\" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click \"Install Now\".\r\n7. On the following page, click \"Activate\".\r\n\r\n### Using FTP\r\n\r\n1. Download the [Standard Child Theme Kit](https://github.com/create156/standard-child-theme-kit-master/archive/master.zip).\r\n2.
